# Web scraping using BeautifulSoap 

In this repo we will be using BeautifulSoap to scrape data from [Pararius Amsterdam rent](https://www.pararius.com/apartments/amsterdam). We will be scraping the `Title`, `Location`, `Price`, `Area`, `Rooms`

# Introduction

Web scraping is an essential skill for data scientist as you will not always have access to data. The easiest way to do web scraping is through **Beautifulsoap** as it’s beginner friendly.

There are more advanced options to do web scrapping like:

- **Selenium:**  originally a web automation tool, it can be used to scrap dynamic websites. You can also use it with other tools like **Beautifulsoap.**
- **Scrappy:** Originally designed for web scraping, it can also be used to extract data using APIs or as a general-purpose web crawler. It’s more advanced than the other tools but it’s more versatile.
